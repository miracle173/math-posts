## Title:
Minimum number of clues for an unsolvable Sudoku

## Text:

I am going to make a distinction between "unsolvable" and "invalid" Sudoku. A Sudoku is *unsolvable* if there is no way to fill in all the spaces without violating a row/column/block constraint. A Sudoku is *invalid* if the clues given violate a row/column/block constraint.

The minimum number of clues needed for an invalid Sudoku is obviously 2. However, I cannot figure how what is the minimum number of clues needed for an unsolvable Sudoku. I found an unsolvable Sudoku with 5 clues (shown below), but I cannot figure out how to proceed for here.
