What if you assume that the function has a linear variation: $f(x)=ax+b$ and deduce by identification that $a=-2/9$ and $b= 5/9$? 
So the function will be $f(x)=(-2x+5)/9$. Verify this in the initial functional equation and you will find out that the left hand side sum will give you $x$ (the right hand side term). The bijectivity will be easy to check.
